# Welcome to Tansu!

Tansu adds an extra layer of security when developing Open Source projects. In essence, it proposes a solution to track code changes and enable anyone to verify that the code hosted on GitHub is indeed the same. Coupled with other best practices, such as, code signing and attestation of provenance, Tansu guarantees that the code history has not been tempered with.
