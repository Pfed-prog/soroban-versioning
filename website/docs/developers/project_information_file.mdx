# Tansu information file

Metadata on the projects are defined in a TOML file using the [SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md) specification-which standardize the Stellar Info File. This file is to be named `tansu.toml` as to avoid the confusion and collision with `stellar.toml`.

- `DOCUMENTATION`: information about the project
- `ACCOUNTS`: public keys of the maintainers
- `PRINCIPALS`: information about maintainers. At least the GitHub handle should be present.

:::note[Order matters]

The order of both `ACCOUNTS` and `PRINCIPALS` is important as to link a maintainer with its public key.

Bellow is a complete example of a project information file:

<CodeBlock language="toml">{tansu_toml}</CodeBlock>
